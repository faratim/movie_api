        <h1>myFlix API Documentation</h1>
        <p class="opening-text">This API will be used as the server-side 
            component for a movie-focused web application called myFlix. 
            Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
            details about many different movies, directors and genres. <br><br>
            Users will have the option to create accounts on the site 
            that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies. 
            This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and 
            architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and 
            MongoDB. <br><br> The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods 
            like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used 
            for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.</p>
