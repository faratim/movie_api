        <h1>myFlix API Documentation</h1>
        <p class="opening-text">This API will be used as the server-side 
            component for a movie-focused web application called myFlix. 
            Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
            details about many different movies, directors and genres. <br><br>
            Users will have the option to create accounts on the site 
            that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies. 
            This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and 
            architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and 
            MongoDB. <br><br> The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods 
            like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used 
            for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.</p>

        "Description": "Drama is a category or genre of narrative fiction (or semi-fiction) intended to be more serious than humorous in tone. Drama of this kind is usually qualified with additional terms that specify its particular super-genre, macro-genre, or micro-genre, such as soap opera, police crime drama, political drama, legal drama, historical drama, domestic drama, teen drama, and comedy-drama (dramedy). These terms tend to indicate a particular setting or subject-matter, or else they qualify the otherwise serious tone of a drama with elements that encourage a broader range of moods. To these ends, a primary element in a drama is the occurrence of conflict—emotional, social, or otherwise—and its resolution in the course of the storyline."

His first job in movies was as a production assistant on the 1981 low-budget film, Hell Night (1981), starring Linda Blair.

Over the course of 15 years of filmmaking, Nolan has gone from low-budget independent films to working on some of the biggest blockbusters ever made. At 7 years old, Nolan began making short movies with his father's Super-8 camera. While studying English Literature at University College London, he shot 16-millimeter films at U.C.L.'s film society, where he learned the guerrilla techniques he would later use to make his first feature, Following (1998), on a budget of around $6,000. The noir thriller was recognized at a number of international film festivals prior to its theatrical release and gained Nolan enough credibility that he was able to gather substantial financing for his next film.",
