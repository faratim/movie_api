        <h1>myFlix API Documentation</h1>
        <p>This API will be used as the server-side 
            component for a movie-focused web application called myFlix. 
            Through this API, the web application will allow users to access
            details about many different movies, directors and genres. 
            Users will have the option to create accounts on the site 
            that will let them create and save lists of their favorite movies. 
            This web app will function through a well-designed REST API and 
            architected database built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express and 
            MongoDB. The REST API will be accessed via commonly-used HTTP methods 
            like GET and POST, and the common CRUD methods will also be used 
            for data retrieval from the database and non-relational data storage.</p>
